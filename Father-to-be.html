    <P> I didn't have my dad around. I spent my whole childhood wondering what life would be like with a father. <br>
        I've watched other kids havin precious moment with their dad, and it always makes me sad. <br>
        I grew out out childhood, but i never grew out of that.I wish to have a husbad who takes care of me like a father, and I should experiment all little things i wish to try on my father to my future husband.<br>
         And that happened with you.

        today, though there is a hole in my heart that will always remain, I get to see my daughter having a father. <br>
         Truly one of the greatest feeling on earth. My baby girl will have the most amazing, caring, loving father.
    </P>
