    <P>Hello remember we're a family now, and it's up to both of us to create sweet and happy moments. The decisions we make should be based on what's best for us, not what others think.

        There was an incident where you had five continuous days off, but you didn't say a word to me. Instead, you discussed it with your mom, and because she said no, you didn't come. Why didn't you think about me, your wife, who was desperately waiting for you?
        
        At that point, I felt devastated. I started to feel like there was no love from your end, and I was the only one developing and becoming addicted to you. So, I decided to focus on being emotionally strong.
        
        
        
        
        
        </P>
